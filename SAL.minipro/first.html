    <li>
      <p>The players will move their pieces according to the number of the dice. If a player rolls a 4, then they
        would move their piece four
        places.</p>
    <li>
      <p>When a player lands on a top of a snake, their playing piece will slide down to the bottom of the snake.
        Landing on the bottom of a snake will have no effect.</p>
    <li>
      <p>When a player lands at the base of a ladder, it immediately climbs to the top of the ladder. Landing at the
        top of a ladder will have no effect.</p>
    <li>
      <p>The first player that reaches the highest space on the board, 100, wins the game.</p>
